# Embargo calendar

## For use in calendar software, like Outlook

You can use this file, `embargoes.ics`, to keep track of OECD embargo dates and hours.

Simply use this URL as the source for a new calendar: 

[https://oecd.github.io/embargo-calendar/embargoes.ics](<https://oecd.github.io/embargo-calendar/embargoes.ics>)

This file is automatically updated every work day (except when it isn't).  Please note that this information is provided on a best-effort basis, and you use it on your own risk. Not all information may be relevant to you.

If you need a hand with adding the calendar to Outlook 2016 (it's quite an easter egg hunt) see here: http://ior.ad/6vHf (but make sure to use the URL indicated above).

## On reminders

Note that reminders exist for each embargo, but they may not be honoured by all calendar clients. MacOS iCal is currently recommended. Outlook 2010 is known not to work. Google Calendar seems to ignore them but may work under certain circomstances. Outlook 2016 seems to have changed its mind and is reminding now. YMMV.

## Other formats

Apart from the ICS format, some other formats are provided:

* [RSS](embargoes.rss)
* [Markdown, by date](embargoes-by-date.md)
* [Markdown, by publication](embargoes-by-publication.md)
* [XML, original format](official-embargoes.xml)
