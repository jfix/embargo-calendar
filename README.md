# Embargo calendar

You can use this file, `embargoes.ics`, to keep track of OECD embargo dates and hours.

Simply use this URL as the source for a new calendar: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oecd/embargo-calendar/master/embargoes.ics

This file is automatically updated every work day (except when it doesn't).  Please note that this information is provided on a best-effort basis, and you use it on your own risk. Not all information may be relevant to you.

## On reminders

Note that reminders exist for each embargo, but they may not be honoured by all calendar clients. MacOS iCal is currently recommended. Outlook 2010 is known not to work. Google Calendar seems to ignore them but may work under certain circomstances.
